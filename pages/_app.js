//initializedOnMount=false means we are not using moralis server
// Header import is done from the script Header.js that we wrote
// Header is implemented in this project like this <Header/>
;/placed <head> tag code/ // so we placed a <head> tag syntax from index.js to here so that it doesnt matter what page we are on the head stays the same
//now we can see we are going to NFT Marketplace no matter what page we are on because we are defining it on the "app" level
;/Moralis server/ // when you create a server in Moralis website you wanna change the "initializedOnMount" to add "appId" and "serverURL"
// add these details as the environement Variable in ".env" file while NextJS comes with built-in support for these environment variables
